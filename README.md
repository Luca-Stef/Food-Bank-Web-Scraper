# Food-Bank-Web-Scraper
Scraped data from the Trussell Trust. Contains all food banks from their interactive map and also quantities of supplies distributed per year per region. 

Ideally we would have live data on foodbank reserves but the Trussell Trust website did not provide this. What it did provide is locations complete with latitudes and longitudes, opening times, and total packages distributed per region. So we could have a rough measure of food  relative food insecurity by calculating how much time a food bank is open per week, how many food banks there are near a given location (or closest food bank for a given location) and total relief packages distributed per region divided by total food banks in that region would be a measure of output per foodbank. 

Next steps are to clean up the address strings.
